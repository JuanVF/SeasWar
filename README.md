# SeasWar
This is the third college project from POO course. The idea is to create a game with a backend server to have a multi player game with sockets.

The idea of the game is there is a war under the sea, you have a civilization and you gotta fight with the other players with some heroes you have. The last who survives win.

The frontend was created using Unity Engine C# and the back with Java.
